          <h2>One Year Anniversary of Teen's Murder Approaches</h2>

            Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary that authorities discovered
            sixteen- year-old Canton teenager Jayden Peters murdered in his
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Police have not named any suspects, and a representative from the
            Canton Precinct says the case remains an active homicide
            investigation. They are asking the public to share any information
            that might help them bring those responsible to justice and provide
            closure for the Peters family and the Canton community. His parents
            send their thanks to all those who have helped over the past year.
          </p>
